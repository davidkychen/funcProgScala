Assignments of Functional Programming in Scala on Coursera

This repo includes some of my work on assignments of Functional Programming Principles in Scala on Coursera.
Including implementing a pure functional set, balance of parenthesis checking, and finding Twitter trending words.

Note: Only the parts I implemented were uploaded since the whole project includes a lot of files.
